# Final_Project

### In This project we have made a script to be used in a computer shop to take care of inventory items.

##E You can add or remove items to the inentory, which will add them to the list of inventory items or remove them.

### We have a counter of total items that are in the shop, which can be found when issuing command "print(Inventory.totalitems)". 

### We also have a counter for each category in the shop.

### you can call "Inventory.display_items()" to get a list of all the items in the inventory
